# hello-world
getting started! - just getting my feet wet
Hello all!

My name is AnnMarie Bemberry. I am a graduate of CUNY - Medgar Evers College. 
I have a Bachelor's of Arts degree in English, with a concentration in Cross-Cultural Literature. 
I enjoy reading, writing, listening to music, watching movies, and making clothes. 
I also play volleyball recreationally and competitively in my spare time.
I am currently in training to become a software engineer. I was asked to create a github account for class. 
This is my first time using github so I'm excited to learn how to use it!
